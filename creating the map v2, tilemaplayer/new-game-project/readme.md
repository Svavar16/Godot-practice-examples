# Creating a new map with the TileMapLayer

this is the new way to create the map, this showed up in v4.3, and is quite easy once you get the hang of it.

## How this works

3 min youtube video [here](https://youtu.be/PuCDAANCBVc?si=vB2ePxOTyhGKEsrP)
more detailed one [here](https://youtu.be/vEyDbROrw0Q?si=W2BonExYcYiugw8Z)

You simply create a new child node, which you should select as TimeMapLayer, and then when that is selected, you go and find the Tile set, create new TileSet,
and remember to select the TileSet at the bottom (the default layout has it at the bottom) then drag the desired image.

within the TileMapLayer inspector, with the TileSet selected, you can add a terrain sets, and physics layers,
these are what will enable you to interact and draw these on the screen

again, at the bottom, you select TileSet, and then within the tiles tap, select paint, and then you can select what you intend to paint, so the physics layer, or the terrain layer.

this is something that's best to learn by experemanting and see how everything works,
