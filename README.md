# Godot-practice-examples

These are various examples using godot  
these will include something like 
- state machines
- attacks, this includes hitbox, hurtbox and health components
- and more ....

These are my personal projects, and each of them should have a readme to explain this further, I will link to where I learned this and feel free to use this as a refresh when learning about godot.
