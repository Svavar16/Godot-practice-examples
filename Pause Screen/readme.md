# a simple game pause with a small menu

this is a simple way to show how to implement a game pause menu  
It should allow the user to "pause" the game if needed

I have this mostly from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWtwYp2lIlQ), with some minor changes and fixes

just as a base example on the differences

- he used a scene called Game, later renamed GameManager, while I had a preloaded script called GameManager
- he added save and load buttons, while I did not,

some minor changes like that.
