# Creating a terrain

This here is how we can create a map, this is for godot v4.2  
There is going to be an update for this within v4.3, so this might change when that comes out

the steps that we will do are as such

something todo, add pictures!!!

By using any tile set, I used this [one](https://craftpix.net/freebies/nature-pixel-art-environment-free-assets-pack/) for this

I followed this [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9jiQGRbE0g) to draw the tile map, this however is lacking adding a physics layer, this is quite simple.

similarly to how you add a terrine, just select the Physics layer, and then within the TileSet (usually located at the bottom), within Tiles, select the paint tool, and in paint property, select the physics layer, and then paint the tiles you want to have a physics layer
