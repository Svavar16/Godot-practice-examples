# options tab for settings

this is a small demo on how to create a settings options  
therefore, I'm not really focusing on the look here, just the base functionality

button assignment is taken from [here](https://www.gotut.net/custom-key-bindings-in-godot-4/)  
Window mode and screen resolution is taken from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsdkcPV0BAo&list=PLhBqFleCVBkXQiE8Nm4Co_1iJJ4L7UIzr&index=4)  
sound options is taken from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWvqvjLJ5Ko&list=PLhBqFleCVBkXQiE8Nm4Co_1iJJ4L7UIzr&index=6)

while we have a save functionality, this is a simple one and if you want something more, I would recommend this [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pR3LF04Gq6g&list=PLhBqFleCVBkXQiE8Nm4Co_1iJJ4L7UIzr&index=7)

as for the load functionality, again, while this simple one will work, this could be done much better, from the same as before, take a look at [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikj71xno2R4&list=PLhBqFleCVBkXQiE8Nm4Co_1iJJ4L7UIzr&index=8) for a much better, but a bit more difficult method of loading
