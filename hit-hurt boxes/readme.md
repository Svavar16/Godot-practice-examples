# hit and hurt boxes

this should show us how to have hit and hurt boxes
this will work later when having the player damage the enemy
then it should be connected with health component

## hit boxes
this is the box that will tell if it has been hit or not.

## hurt boxes
this is the box that will the if it has been hurt or not, this should detect when the hit box enters it.

## how this will work
so if the (player in this case) where to attack the enemy, then it would call the hit box,  
and then (in this case the enemy) would call the hurt box, this would later be connected to a health component
